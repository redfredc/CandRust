# C and Rust : A Tale of Two Languages

One of the defining traits of the C programming language is that it trusts you. Entirely. That trust comes with power ‚Äî and also with the burden of micromanagement.

Rust, by contrast, is not so much about trust as it is about **partnership**. It assumes you're intelligent ‚Äî but also acknowledges that you might be tired, distracted, or moving too fast.

Let‚Äôs take a deceptively simple task:  

> **Compute the square root of only the non-negative numbers in a list, skipping any missing (null) entries, and find the average.**

It‚Äôs the kind of problem that surfaces everything: memory safety, null handling, arithmetic correctness, and transformation clarity.

## üõ†Ô∏è In C: The Power and the Pain

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    double v1 = 1.0, v2 = 2.5, v3 = 4.0, v4 = -3.0, v5 = 3.5;
    double* data[] = { &v1, NULL, &v2, &v3, &v4, NULL, &v5 };
    size_t len = sizeof(data) / sizeof(data[0]);

    double sum = 0.0;
    int count = 0;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        if (data[i] == NULL) continue;
        double x = *data[i];
        if (x < 0.0) continue;

        double root = sqrt(x);
        if (isnan(root)) continue;

        sum += root;
        count++;
    }

    if (count > 0) {
        printf("Average: %f\n", sum / count);
    } else {
        printf("Average: None\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Try this Rust version in the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)!

```rust
fn main() {
    let data = vec![
        Some(1.0), None, Some(2.5), Some(4.0), Some(-3.0), None, Some(3.5),
    ];

    let average = data
        .into_iter()
        .flatten()
        .filter(|&x| x >= 0.0)
        .map(|x: f64| x.sqrt())
        .fold((0.0, 0), |(sum, count), x| (sum + x, count + 1))
        .pipe(|(sum, count)| if count > 0 { Some(sum / count as f64) } else { None });

    println!("Average: {:?}", average);
}

trait Pipe: Sized {
    fn pipe<F, R>(self, f: F) -> R where F: FnOnce(Self) -> R { f(self) }
}
impl<T> Pipe for T {}

## ‚öñÔ∏è C vs Rust at a Glance

| Feature                  | C                        | Rust                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Null Handling            | Manual (`NULL`)          | `Option<T>` with `.flatten()` |
| Negative Value Filtering | `if (x < 0)`             | `.filter(|x| x >= 0.0)`       |
| Square Root              | `sqrt(x)`                | `.map(|x: f64| x.sqrt())`     |
| Average Calculation      | Manual loop, count check | `.fold()` + `.pipe()`         |
| Safety                   | On you                   | Built into compiler           |
| Error Reporting          | None                     | Rich and actionable           |

## üß† Why Functional Style Wins in Rust

The **functional approach** in Rust isn't just prettier. It‚Äôs more reliable.

You think in terms of **data transformation pipelines**, which the compiler understands. That means better error messages, fewer bugs, and much easier reasoning. You spend more time solving the real problem ‚Äî not fighting undefined behavior.

In C, code that looks simple often hides a web of assumptions and edge cases. In Rust, the same logic is **self-documenting, verifiable, and testable**.

---

## ‚ú® Conclusion

C is fast, direct, and timeless. But it demands constant vigilance.  
Rust is just as fast ‚Äî but insists on correctness from the start.

If you‚Äôre building systems that need **both performance and safety**, Rust isn't just an option. It‚Äôs a statement: _we care about correctness_.

## Notes

For comparison, here is an imperative style equivalent of the Rust program.

```rust
fn main() {
    let v1 = 1.0;
    let v2 = 2.5;
    let v3 = 4.0;
    let v4 = -3.0;
    let v5 = 3.5;

    let data: Vec<Option<f64>> = vec![Some(v1), None, Some(v2), Some(v3), Some(v4), None, Some(v5)];

    let mut sum = 0.0;
    let mut count = 0;

    for item in &data {
        if let Some(x) = item {
            if *x >= 0.0 {
                let root = x.sqrt();
                if !root.is_nan() {
                    sum += root;
                    count += 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    if count > 0 {
        println!("Average: {}", sum / count as f64);
    } else {
        println!("Average: None");
    }
}

```
